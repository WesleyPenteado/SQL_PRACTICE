-- 1) Daily count of active customers (bought at least twice)

SELECT
    customerkey,
    COUNT(distinct orderkey) AS total_orders
FROM sales
GROUP BY
    customerkey
HAVING
    COUNT(distinct orderkey) >= 2
ORDER BY
    total_orders DESC;

-- 2.1) Find the 2nd highest order without using LIMIT or TOP

WITH dense_rank AS (
    SELECT
        orderkey,
        SUM(netprice * quantity / exchangerate) AS net_price,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(

    GROUP BY
        orderkey
)
SELECT
    orderkey,

-- 2.2) Find the 5nd highest quantity order without using LIMIT or TOP

with rank_table AS (

-> Inner Join or JOIN only show rows where the join was successful.
-> Often  safer than a LEFT JOIN
*/
