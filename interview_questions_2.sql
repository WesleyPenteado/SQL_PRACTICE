-- 1. SELF-JOIN -------------------------------------------------------------------------



-- a) Compare this month's sales to last month

WITH table_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        to_char(orderdate, 'YYYY-MM') as order_month,
        ROUND(SUM(netprice * quantity * exchangerate)::NUMERIC,2) as net_revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY
        order_month
)
SELECT *,
    LAG(net_revenue) OVER(ORDER BY order_month) AS prev_month_revenue,
    net_revenue - LAG(net_revenue) OVER(ORDER BY order_month) AS month_diff
FROM table_revenue
ORDER BY
    order_month DESC


-- b) Master: joining a table to itself with different aliases
-- Pro tip: THing of it as creating two copies of the same table


-- Finding consecutive days of activity
SELECT 
    s1.customerkey,
    s1.orderdate AS current_date,
    s2.orderdate AS next_date
FROM sales s1
JOIN sales s2
    ON s1.customerkey = s2.customerkey
   AND s2.orderdate = s1.orderdate + INTERVAL '1 day'
GROuP BY 
    s1.customerkey,
    s1.orderdate,
    s2.orderdate;



-- 2. Running Total -------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- a) Calculate cumulative revenue by month

WITH table_orders AS (
SELECT
    to_char(orderdate, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(unitprice * quantity * exchangerate)::numeric, 2) as net_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY month
)
SELECT
    month,
    net_revenue,
    SUM(net_revenue) OVER(
        ORDER BY month ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS rolling_revenue
FROM table_orders
ORDER BY month DESC;


-- b) Calculate year to date calculations

WITH table_orders AS (
SELECT
    to_char(orderdate, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    extract(year from orderdate) AS year,
    ROUND(SUM(unitprice * quantity * exchangerate)::numeric, 2) as net_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY month, year
)
SELECT
    month,
    year,
    net_revenue,
    SUM(net_revenue) OVER(
        PARTITION BY year
        ORDER BY month ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS rolling_revenue
FROM table_orders
ORDER BY month DESC;

-- c) Moving Averages (Two before + current) for projections

WITH table_orders AS (
SELECT
    to_char(orderdate, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(unitprice * quantity * exchangerate)::numeric, 2) as net_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY month
)
SELECT
    month,
    net_revenue,
    AVG(net_revenue) OVER(
        ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS rolling_avg
FROM table_orders
ORDER BY month DESC;
